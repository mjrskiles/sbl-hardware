# Format:
#   PERIPHERAL:
#     registers:
#       REGISTER_NAME:
#         addressOffset: 0xNN  # Correct offset
#         _delete: true        # Remove bogus register

RCC:
  registers:
    # SVD has CSR at 0x74, but RM0433 Table 54 shows it at 0x78
    # This 4-byte error propagates to all subsequent registers
    CSR:
      addressOffset: 0x78  # Fix: SVD says 0x74, RM0433 says 0x78
